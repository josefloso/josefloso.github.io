# Day 10: Terraform Loops and Conditionals

## Overview

This day covers three Terraform meta-arguments and expression types that make infrastructure code reusable and environment-aware: `count`, `for_each`, and conditionals using the ternary operator. The webserver cluster module from Days 8 and 9 is refactored to support optional autoscaling and environment-driven instance sizing, then deployed across dev and production to verify the conditional behaviour.

## Concepts Covered

### count
The simplest loop — creates N identical copies of a resource using an index. The limitation: if you use count with a list and remove an item from the middle, Terraform renumbers all subsequent resources and recreates them. This is destructive and unexpected.

### for_each
Solves the ordering problem by keying resources on a map or set value instead of a numeric index. Removing one entry only touches that specific resource. Preferred over count whenever you are iterating over a collection of named items.

### for expressions
Transform collections inline inside resource arguments, outputs, or locals. They do not create resources — they reshape data. Used here to produce a clean map of autoscaling policy names to ARNs in the module output.

### Conditionals
Terraform uses the ternary operator: `condition ? true_value : false_value`. Combined with count, this makes resources optional:

```hcl
count = var.enable_autoscaling ? 1 : 0
```

Combined with locals, this centralises environment-driven sizing decisions:

```hcl
locals {
  instance_type = var.environment == "production" ? "t2.medium" : "t2.micro"
}
```

## Module Changes (v0.0.3)

Two new variables added to the standalone module:

- `enable_autoscaling` (bool, default: true) — controls whether scale-out and scale-in autoscaling policies are created
- `environment` (string, default: "dev") — drives instance type selection via a local

New resources added:

- `aws_autoscaling_policy.scale_out` — created only when `enable_autoscaling = true`
- `aws_autoscaling_policy.scale_in` — created only when `enable_autoscaling = true`

New output added:

- `autoscaling_policy_arns` — a for expression producing a map of policy name to ARN

## Deployment Results

### Dev (enable_autoscaling = false, environment = "dev")

```
Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
alb_dns_name            = "webservers-dev-alb-508599619.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
asg_name                = "webservers-dev-asg"
autoscaling_policy_arns = {}
```

### Production (enable_autoscaling = true, environment = "production")

```
Outputs:
alb_dns_name            = "webservers-production-alb-350535575.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
asg_name                = "webservers-production-asg"
autoscaling_policy_arns = {
  "webservers-production-scale-out" = "arn:aws:autoscaling:eu-central-1:..."
}
```

The empty map in dev and the populated map in production confirm the conditional is working correctly.

## Key Takeaway

Use `for_each` over `count` for named resources. Use `count = condition ? 1 : 0` to make resources optional. Keep conditional logic inside locals rather than scattering ternary operators through resource arguments — it makes the code easier to read and reason about.

## Conclusion

Day 10 moves Terraform code from static to expressive. Before today the module always created the same set of resources regardless of where it was deployed. After today the same module behaves differently based on two boolean inputs — no duplicate resource blocks, no environment-specific modules, no copy-paste. The for expression in the output turns a list of resources into a usable map with a single line. These patterns — conditional creation, for_each keying, for expression outputs — appear in almost every real-world Terraform codebase and are worth understanding deeply before moving on.
